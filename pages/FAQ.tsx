            question: 'What makes your linens eco-friendly?',
            answer: 'Our linens are crafted from 100% organic, sustainably sourced materials. We use GOTS-certified organic cotton and European flax, ensuring no harmful chemicals are used in cultivation or processing. Every step of our production adheres to strict environmental standards.'
        },
        {
            question: 'How do I care for my linen bedding?',
            answer: 'Machine wash in cold water on a gentle cycle. Use mild, eco-friendly detergent and avoid bleach. Tumble dry on low or line dry for best results. Linen becomes softer with each wash and doesn\'t require ironing - the natural texture is part of its charm.'
        },
        {
            question: 'Do you offer international shipping?',
            answer: 'Yes! We ship worldwide. Shipping costs and delivery times vary by location. Free shipping is available for orders over $150 within the continental US. International orders may be subject to import duties and taxes.'
        },
        {
            question: 'What is your return policy?',
            answer: 'We offer a 30-day satisfaction guarantee. If you\'re not completely satisfied with your purchase, you can return unwashed and unused items for a full refund. Original shipping costs are non-refundable. Please see our Shipping & Returns page for complete details.'
        },
        {
            question: 'Are your products ethically made?',
            answer: 'Absolutely. We partner with Fair Trade Certified factories that ensure safe working conditions, fair wages, and sustainable practices. We visit our production facilities regularly and maintain transparent relationships with all our suppliers.'
        },
        {
            question: 'How long will my order take to arrive?',
            answer: 'Standard shipping within the US takes 5-7 business days. Express shipping (2-3 business days) is available. International orders typically arrive within 10-15 business days. You\'ll receive tracking information once your order ships.'
        },
        {
            question: 'Do your linens come in different sizes?',
            answer: 'Yes! We offer all standard sizes: Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, and California King. Custom sizes are available upon request - please contact us for a quote.'
        },
        {
            question: 'What thread count are your sheets?',
            answer: 'Thread count is less meaningful for linen than for cotton. Our linens are measured by weight (GSM - grams per square meter). We use premium 180-220 GSM fabric that provides the perfect balance of breathability, durability, and softness.'
